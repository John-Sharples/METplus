This directory contains the feature_relative.conf file, which contains all the necessary information to run a simple feature relative case.  The configuration files in the examples directory pertain to specific use cases: series analysis by init time, series analysis by lead time with forecast hour groupings, and series analysis by lead time for each and all forecast hours in the specified range.


1)  To run the simple feature relative use case, run the following use cases in the specified order:
    -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/feature_relative.conf -c <path/to>/my_custom.conf


where my_custom.conf is the user's configuration file with the specified directories for input and output:
[dir]
INPUT_BASE = 
PROJ_DIR = 
OUTPUT_BASE = 
PARM_BASE = 
TMP_DIR = 
MET_INSTALL_DIR +

Where:
INPUT_BASE is the base directory where all input data is located
PROJ_DIR  is the base directory where all output files will be located
OUTPUT_BASE is typically a subdirectory of the PROJ_DIR but doesn't necessarily need to be
PARM_BASE is the base directory where parameter files are located
TMP_DIR is the directory where all temporary files will be saved
MET_INSTALL_DIR is the location where your version of MET is installed (e.g. /usr/local/met-8.1)

[exe]
WGRIB2 =
RM =
CUT =
TR =
NCAP2 =
CONVERT =
NCDUMP =
EGREP =


where the settings under the [exe] header/family are the non-MET executables used in performing the series analysis.  Assign each setting to the appropriate path for your data.


2)  To run a more specialized version of #1 above (changing the time window of interest), run the following, in the specified order 
(to ensure the correct overriding behavior):
    -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/feature_relative.conf -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/examples/series_by_init_12-14_to_12-16.conf -c <path/to>/my_custom.conf

where my_custom.conf is the user's specified directories for input and output, as described above.


3)  To run the series by lead example, where all fhrs are grouped together, run the following in the specified order (to ensure the correct overriding behavior):
    -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/feature_relative.conf -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/examples/series_by_lead_all_fhrs.conf -c <path/to>/my_custom.conf

where my_custom.conf is the user's specified directories for input and output, as described above.

4)  To run the series by lead example where fhrs are separated into separate days' worth of results, run the following in the specified order 
(to ensure the correct overriding behavior):
    -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/feature_relative.conf -c parm/use_cases/feature_relative/examples/series_by_lead_by_fhr_grouping.conf -c <path/to>/my_custom.conf

where my_custom.conf is the user's specified directories for input and output, as described above.
