=============
Pre-condition:
==============

1) Verify that there is data in the directory /d1/METplus_Pointstat/dummy_data/nam/conus_sfc
2) If not, then you will need to run the grid_to_obs use case following the instructions below.

Instructions are for running tests on host 'eyewall'...
Run the grid_to_obs use case, setting the custom conf file to the following, replacing the /path/to to your path where
you downloaded the METplus source code:
[dir]
INPUT_BASE = /d1/METplus_Data
PROJ_DIR = /d1/METplus_Pointstat
OUTPUT_BASE = {PROJ_DIR}/dummy_data
PARM_BASE = <path/to>METplus/parm
MET_INSTALL_DIR = /usr/local/met-8.1
TMP_DIR = {OUTPUT_BASE}/tmp

# POINT STAT
FCST_POINT_STAT_INPUT_DIR = /d1/METplus_Data/grid_to_obs/gfs


[exe]
WGRIB2 = /usr/local/bin/wgrib2
RM = /bin/rm
CUT = /usr/bin/cut
TR = /usr/bin/tr
NCAP2 =/usr/local/nco/bin/ncap2
CONVERT = /usr/bin/convert
NCDUMP = /usr/local/bin/ncdump
EGREP = /bin/egrep


and run the use case with the following command:

python master_metplus -c ../parm/use_cases/grid_to_obs/grid_to_obs.conf
                      -c ../parm/use_cases/grid_to_obs/examples/conus_sfc.conf
                      -c <path/to/your>/custom.conf

                      where path/to/your is replaced with the path to where your custom.conf
                      file is located.


================
Running the test
================
cd to the directory where this test resides:
<path/to>/METplus/internal_tests/pytests/grid_to_obs_util

run the following from the command line (you may need to include the /usr/local/python/bin/pytest to your path or
create an alias):

> pytest
