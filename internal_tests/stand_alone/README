These tests are simple tests that can be run without the pytest framework.  Originally designed to run for CROW sprint, 
in anticipation of a run-time host where pytest is not installed.  Currently run manually, not part of any automation scheme.


To run this test, make sure you have your PYTHONPATH pointing to the path where your METplus source code resides.

From the command line, run the following:

cd to <path/to/METplus/internal_tests/stand_alone
python test_produtil_for_metplus.py -c ./produtil_for_METplus.conf

You may see some "FAIL" messages, as there have been some major refactors to the wrappers and since these tests were created.
