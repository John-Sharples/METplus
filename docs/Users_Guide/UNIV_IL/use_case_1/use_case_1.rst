Some Descriptive Name Here
==========================

The file being rendered on this page is actually a ".py" file.

However, sphinx-gallery supports rendering RST from within a ".py" file.

We can leverage the thumbnail-like gallery function of sphinx-gallery by writing RST in the example ".py" file.

The advantage to this, is we can do things like incorporate static images:

.. image:: ../../../../docs/_static/METplus_logo.png

Or we can just write straight Python code:


.. code-block:: default


    import os, subprocess

    x = 1

    my_list = ['Dan','George','Minna']


We can even use fancy LaTeX MATH stuff:

.. math:: \sin (x)


.. code-block:: default


    for i in my_list:
      print("Name = ",i)


The file is essentially a hybrid Python/RST file

At the bottom of each PY file, we should include a ".. tip::" directive, and then include each MET tool.
Example:

.. note:: GridStatUseCase, PB2NCUseCase


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-timing
